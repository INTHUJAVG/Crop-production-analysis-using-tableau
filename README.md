# Crop-production-analysis-using-tableau
- Crop production analysis in India is a crucial aspect of the country's agricultural sector, which plays a central role in the nation's economy and sustenance of its vast population. India, known for its diverse agro-climatic zones, cultivates a wide range of crops, contributing significantly to its food security and livelihoods of millions.
- The analysis of crop production in India involves examining various factors that influence agricultural output, such as climate conditions, soil quality, water availability, technology adoption, and government policies. With the majority of the population dependent on agriculture, understanding and optimizing crop production are essential for ensuring food sufficiency and rural development.
- In this project we are going to analyze a dataset which provides information on crop production in India ranging from several years.

## DETAILS OF DATASET
- The Dataset contains
	- Seasons of crop production
	- Years from 1997 to 2015
	- Area of production
	- State and district of production
	- Types of crops produced

## Main KPIâ€™s
- Top 3 states with highest crop production in all season
- Top 3 crops with highest production
- Production over years with season
- Comparison of Crop Production in different season
- Production in different districts
